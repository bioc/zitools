\title{Convert a 'Zi'-class object to a DESeq2 dds object}
\usage{
zi_to_deseq2(ZiObject, design, colData, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{ZiObject}{'Zi'-class object}

\item{design}{A formula which specifies the design of the experiment, taking
the form formula(~ x + y + z). That is, a formula with right-hand side only.
By default, the functions in this package and DESeq2 will use the last variable
in the formula (e.g. z) for presenting results (fold changes, etc.) and plotting.
When considering your specification of experimental design, you will want to re-order the
levels so that the NULL set is first.}

\item{colData}{if the inputdata of the 'Zi'-class object is a matrix: a
DataFrame or data.frame with at least a single column. Rows of colData
correspond to columns of countData}
}
\description{
A 'Zi'-class object is converted to a DESeqDataSet object, which
can be used for DESeq2 analysis. Both, weight and count matrices will be
stored in assays of the DESeqDataSet.
}

Description:
  zitools allows for zero inflated count data analysis by either using 
  down-weighting of excess zeros or by replacing an appropriate proportion of 
  excess zeros with NA. Through overloading frequently used statistical 
  functions (such as mean, median, standard deviation), plotting functions 
  (such as boxplots or heatmap) or differential abundance tests, it allows a 
  wide range of downstream analyses for zero-inflated data in a less biased 
  manner. This becomes applicable in the context of microbiome analyses, where 
  the data is often overdispersed and zero-inflated, therefore making data 
  analysis extremly challenging.
